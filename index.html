                <h3>Wilder Institute (The Calgary Zoo)</h3>
                <p class="description">The Wilder Institute, formerly known as the Calgary Zoo, is full of excitement. Even in the winter, the institute is a great place to visit  with friends and family. You will see foreign species, ranging from African giants to tiny Asian lizards. And, don't forget to check out the Canadian Wild! Here you can find wolves, buffalo, mountain goats, and of course the polar bear, Siku!</p>
                <p class="description">The penguins are adorable and you can get right up close to them either in their enclosure or on the amazing penguin walk! Even within the enclosure, there is a chance that a penguin will walk with you anyways, as some of them like to jump out to say hello!</p>

                <h3>Burnstick Lake</h3>
                <p class="description">Burnstick Lake is a beautiful, but secluded interest point roughly 2 hours northwest of Calgary. It has a campground and a village with about 50 cabins. During the summer, visitors spend their time swimming in the lake, going for boat rides (including tubing, water skiing, wakeboarding, etc.), and of course, fishing.</p>
                <p class="description">In the winter, the lake freezes over and the community shovels ice rinks on the lake, as well as an amazing ice trial that goes out to the west point of the lake. Many owners of snow machines also bring them out to ride on the lake and on forest trails. It is the perfect weekend getaway from the city.</p>
